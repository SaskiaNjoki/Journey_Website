  <p> " I will be able to approach that teacher once I have aced the tests"<br> "I will attend the friend's hangout once I purchase that specific pair of shoes or plait that cool hairstyle"<br> "I will attempt answering the questions once I have a better understanding of that topic" <br>
    This is just but a tip of the ice-berg on how I defined and expected the manifestation of self-confidence in my life;a viscious circle of whens with the finish line constantly appearing to move further.
  </p>

  <p> With time I came to the realization that self-confidence is a journey. For some it's slow paced and for others it might manifest a little bit quicker and easier based on upbringing, backgrounds, the company they keep and for me it was about the thoughts I cultivated. <br>  Understanding we all don't have similar journeying experiences as some have to hike higher mountains and fight bigger battles allows us to be more compasionate and kind with ourselves through the process of attaining self-confidence. <br> I have come to realize there is no one-size-fits-all recipe to attaining self-confidence. There are multiple theories to the how from thinking happy thoughts,to positive affirmations,to standing up straight and smiling, faking it till you make it and the list goes on. They all work in different proportions for different individuals.</p>


  <p> For me when I whittle all that into a single breath,it essentially comes out like this; <strong>"You Are Enough For Now"</strong> <br> What you are dressed up in right now is enough for you to show up.<br> What you have in mind right now is enough for you to speak it out.<br> The knowledge capacity you have right now is enough for you to ask that question and gain better understanding as time progresses.<br> Nothing has helped me take away the feeling of inadequacy and anxiety as believing that for the moment what you have is enough to offer and work towards betterment with every passing day.</p>

  <p>Self-confidence is a self-project constantly under construction and my steps have been guided to fruition by a five-words simple daily mantra; <br>                                                     

    <strong><i>For Now,You Are Enough</i></strong></p>
