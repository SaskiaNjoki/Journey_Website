  <p> Despite achieving independence, the influences of colonialism are still very much present in our current living with its importations impacting our existence both positively and negatively</p>

         
  Long post independence,most of African culture seeemingly got eroded with the introduction and cementing of new practices that portrayed African culture as outdated. There were transitions in the mode of dresssing, approach to traditional ceremonies and customs and mode of worship as well. With christianity being adopted and becoming the most generic religion it fostered adoption of new ways which led to the decline and detachment from most traditional culture which fades by the day. Most of the cultural identities and heritage became undermined by the western cultural identity and the society adopted new ways of living with no chance of transitioning back into the prior setting.

<p>Additionally neo-colonialism is still visible in the societal gaps that exist between social classes with people holding higher govermental ranks having greater priviledges. For instance in colonial period land grabbing by colonial administrators was a norm which has been imported into the current system where law is breached based on financial and sociatal superiority and goes unquestioned as it has already been normalized and accepted.</p>


  <h4> Positive Transitions</h4>

  In medieval ages academics was a less prioritized aspect until colonialism took control and the education system was introduced along with christianity as part of the colonial rule. Its impact had a ripple effect on more than a single sector of the society. For instance the embracing of higher academic pursuits which brought along discovery of numerous more fields and adoption of technology which has seen automation of many mundane tasks,eased operations and bridged many societal gaps. Despite the cons attached to technological advancements, people still drift towards its workings and evolve with the majority for adaptability.



<p>Adoption of imported western culture saw an upgrade in social living standards as individuals gained insights and revolutionized on the issues surrounding gender disparirties in the economic world. With adoption of Western culture the then mentality of only the male gender being the sole earners for a home became an eroded practice that saw more women embrace the slot of putting themselves out. This is currently a lived out norm that has not fully attained but is creating an economic balance between both genders and overseeing the archaic ways in financial handling leaving no room for return. </p>
