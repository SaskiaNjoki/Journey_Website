  <h2>The Power Of Visualization.</h2>

            <p>I remember being opinionated and outspoken but my level of timidity would always be a hindrance to me expressing my ideas publicly.<br> What if I experience stage fright?<br> What if I forget my points?
              Visualizing the outcome of an event,its objective and what the entire process may be is key.Taking time to take your mind through the entire  situation and the likelihood of the experience.
              The more we familiarize with the situations,events and conversations that bring  a feeling of uncertainty the better approaches we have to how we deal with them.

            <p> In the book Man's Search For Meaning, the author Victor Frankl quotes;<br> There's one reason why I am here today.What kept me alive in a situation where others had given up and died was the dream that someday I'd be here telling you how I survived the concentration camps.<br>I've never been here before. I've never seen any of you before. Nor have I ever given this speech before. But in my dreams I've stood before you in this room and said these words a thousand times.
            </p>
            <p>Franklâ€™s thought process gave him meaning and helped him push through the adversity of everyday life at the camps.He focused on finding meaning in every little moment. Whether it was the thought of being reunited with his wife or his constant reflection on the ideas of Logotherapy, Frankl passed time by pondering what was meaningful to him.</p>

            <p> Similar to Frankl's situation,when life serves us lemons, we must be having and embracing those goals that are worth suffering for. And as we struggle to meet them, and wrestle with the inherent difficulty of life, we find the meaning we seek in our lives through the journey.</p>
