            <p>Covid-19 came as such an unprecedented global emergency creating a negative impact on quite a number of sections including the academic section including closure of academic institutions which left most teenagers and youths in limbo in regards to how to navigate with their lives as everything seemingly stands still.<br> Youth engagement and action to help fight the pandemic and successflly navigate through it themselves can take many shapes starting from the grassroot initiatives led by the youths themselves, to partnering with organizations and platforms that allow youths share their opinions and experiences on what affects them during this phase</p>  

            <p>Building up the capacity of youth to be able to make their own decisions and to take responsibility for their own life is a key element.Young innovators are already responding to the pandemic through projects and voluntary initiatives that hold social impact.<br>
            As a mean of navigation during this pandemic phase, youths can/have been using their access to insights concerning the virus to raise awareness to fight misinformation and dispell myths surrounding the pandemic. This has in return helped them work on their interests and talents as well for instance using spoken words and graffiti as a means of mass education about covid-19</p>

            <p><strong>Charity begins at home!</strong>Nothing feels better than having a sense of belonging when chaos is all that seems to ensue our current living.<br> Youths can use their time during this period by supporting their communities through maintaining access to basic services and running humanitarian services to the under priviledged. For instance, distribution of soap and sanitation kits,food packages and sanitary products in rural areas with limited access. This would not only be a reflection of their willingnesst to participate in issues concerning the crisis but a also a chance to be part of a community and a path to self realization.</p>

            <p><h5>Finding the silver lining in the cloud</h5><br>
            With all closed down and barely much outdoor involvement, this would be an opportune time for youths and teens to re-focus on their aspirations and re-evaluate their personal journeys from all dimensions. This can be achieved by journeying towards acquiring new skills by exploring other fields to discover what else possibly sparks their souls. For teenagers and young kids it would be the right time for parents to throw in the "what would you like to be when you grow up?" question and guide them through exploring what it means to be in that desired field in relation to what currently surrounds us. For instance learn how a chemist is involved in helping solve this pandemic or how undestanding mathematics and applying statisticals skills could help predict the possibility of such a pandemic again or not.</p>
